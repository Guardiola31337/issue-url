Issue id URL generator (Chrome extension)
=========================================

Chrome extension that generates the issue id URL based on the clicked issue and copy it to the clipboard.

You'll never have to do again the following boilerplate sequence:

`Right click` → `Inspect` → `Find issue id` → `Double click on issue id` → `Copy issue id` → `Get current URL` → `Add /# to the end of the URL` → `Paste issue id` → `Copy generated URL`
